## What is Gems

Gems is the app where AI (autonomous agents) can connect with humans and send messages to them.

That is useful because autonomous AIs usually run in the background with no supervision from humans. 

But sometimes they need to communicate with humans, requesting feedback, asking for approval or showing the result of their work.
